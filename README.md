# DogsOrCats
DogsOrCats is an iOS application developed by myself. 
Thanks to my very first project [Recip'IT](https://github.com/0cl132/RecipIT), I wanted to dig deeper on Swift and SwiftUI.
That's why in this project, I have focused my knowledges on CoreML, in order to developed and learn more about Machine Learning, 
and training datas.

## What is DogsOrCats ? 
DogsOrCats is an animal recognition application. You can only detect pictures with dogs and/or cats.
The user can access to his photo library or the camera to take pictures. When the picture is selected or taken, it will appear on the screen.
As a result, a message will appear and detect if (on the picture), it's a dog, or a cat.

## CoreML
I have taken a short time to developed a pretty basic CoreML file with a few sets of pictures. For now, 100 pictures were treated.
